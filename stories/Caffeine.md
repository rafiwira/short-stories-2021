# Caffeine

I hate graveyard shifts. I had managed to stay away from it for as long as I was assigned to this station. Humans were never created to stay up late.

I looked at my watch.

12.59AM

I wish time would just pass by quicker.

I took my cup off my desk and went out to the pantry. Coffee does nothing much for me but it just tastes good. I’m surprised they have such exquisitely tasting coffee in this station.

As I was sipping my coffee, there was a little tremor. I know my tremors and this one felt different.

I looked at my watch.

13.01AM

I blinked and rubbed my eyes. I tapped my watch.

There was no mistaking it. My watch. It’s showing 13. A little creepy. But I don’t think it’s anything to be alarmed about.

I went back to my desk and picked up the radio.

“Sierra to all units. Is everything okay out there?”

Static.

“Sierra to all units. Check-in.”

Static.

The air got chillier. Too chilly in fact. I went up to my weapon rack and loaded my rifle. I’m not a supersitious person by nature. But it’s never too much to be careful.

I walked out again. To the main corridor this time. I’ll need to link up with my team and see what exactly is going on.

The light kept flickering. And suddenly it switched to the red lights. I started to pick up my speed. That uneasy feeling I had, started getting stronger.

I turned the corner.

And bumped onto someone.

We both fell.

“God damn. Watch where you going Rufio.” The guy I bumped into scowled.

I picked myself up and shone my light on him. It was my 2-IC Desmond.

“Hey Des. What’s going on.”

“I’m not sure Chief. The station got wonky. I was trying to get to you. You okay?”

“Yeah i’m fine.”

I pointed my rifle at him.

“Chief. What are you doing.”

“How did you know it was me.”

Silence.

Somehow the corridor got darker. Desmond started to fade darker too. I shot my rifle.

He wailed and threw something in my direction.

I dodged and when I turned to look, he was gone. The corridor had went back to normal. I looked at my watch.

2.00AM

What in the Heavens is happening.
