# Chamber

My blood turned cold. Slime full of bones and half digested bodies, stuck on walls and ceiling. It stretched out as far as my light could reach. We walked right into it. This was on me. Aisyah had warned me but I never thought this was a possibility. We need to get out of this and we'll need to be smart about it. The next move we make might be our last.

I looked over to John. His hands tightened around the flamethrower. He was ready to fight this thing. I shook my head. We can't blindly burn this thing. We don't have enough gas for this. Even if we had, there might be living people in the slime. I shone my light to where we were from. There were no signs of the slime. The possibility was that up ahead may be where its main core was. We're not prepared to face it. It's better that we back away and make a detour.

I signed to John. As quietly as we could, we're going to go around this mess.

<i>CLANG clang clang</i>

My already cold body grew colder. I could feel my breath slowing. I looked around and saw the slimes wriggling, reacting to the noise. It started to spread itself out as if trying to find the cause of the noise. Most of it were moving away from us but a few of it were coming closer.

One of them was too close to John.

He clicked the torch and lit it up.

It let out a sound that was akin to a shriek of a boiling kettle as it vaporised. Liquid dripped off of it as John continued to burn it. It didn't back away. Instead, it lunged forward and struck John's hand. He howled in pain. I rushed towards him and grabbed him by the waist, carrying him up to my shoulder. I didn't look back. I kept running. I have to outrun this thing.

Then I felt it.

A tightness around my thigh. My pants felt wet. Slowly I could feel it penetrating through my skin, as though water was seeping into my body.

I tried to move my legs but it won't obey. It was distressing. I could feel it. The slime were immobilising my muscles.

Desperate, I threw John as hard as I could.

But it caught him too.

It dragged us in deeper into the corridor. Darker, colder. There was nothing I could see. I could feel it slowing down, and it started to cover more of me. There was nothing I could do.

"Close your eyes." An unfamiliar voice.

Suddenly, bright light exploded above us, lighting every corner of the environment. It was bright enough for me to identify the place we're in. This was the generator chamber. One of the largest places in the station and it was filled with slime.

I felt the slime around me hardened up and grew icy cold. A masked figure ran up to me and broke the icy slime with a hit of a large sledgehammer. Without wasting any moment, he grabbed me and pulled me away.

"No wait!" I shouted.

"I got him too." he replied as he led me into a small entryway.
