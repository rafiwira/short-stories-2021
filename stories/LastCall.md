# Last Call

I pressed my hands against the cold walls as I shuffled my way along the corridor. The only bits of light was from the large windows of the station. Lights from the closest stars.

I’m not sure what happened. All I know was the station switched to emergency lights. Then that went off too. And then I felt the air getting thinner. I haven’t came across anyone.

Finally I reached the emergency meet-up point. But all I see was a mess. Like a riot happened. Common benches and chairs stacked or misplaced. There were spots of liquid here and there. I assumed those were blood from how the place smelled.

“Just what is going on.”

I heard a soft beeping coming from some pile of chairs. I dug around and found a small comlink.

I clicked on it.

“Hello.” A raspy voice came out of it.

“Hi. You rang?”

“Good God. Finally someone picked up. What happened over there?”

I looked around.

“I’m not sure. I was alone in my room when all this happened.”

The comlink was quiet for awhile.

“That doesn’t matter now. Get yourself to the escape pod.”

The escape pod wasn’t too far off. Each section of the station has a dedicated number of escape pods enough for the nearby residents.

It didn’t take long for me to find it. Along the way, I found the emergency flashlight. I kind of hoped I didn’t. Because it confirmed my fear. Something else was in this station. There were drag marks all around. Blood smears. Not too sure if I should say that I was lucky enough not to find any bodies.

I shone lights around the eacape pod area.

There were no more pods.

All of them empty.

I clicked on the comlink.

“There seems to be an issue. The pods here are empty.”

“Empty… but we didn’t pickup any launched pods.”

“How…”

“… let’s not think about that. For now, get to the next nearest pods you can get to.”

“Sure. Just give…”

Before I could complete my sentence, a foul stench crept up to my nose. It was so bad that I gagged.

“HELLO. HELLO. ARE YOU THERE?”

I tried to reply. But the stench was too strong.

“Dammit. If you can hear me. Run. RUN!”

I tried to move my body. I hobbled over and held on to the guide rails.

Then I felt it. Slimy. Creeping up my arms and around my neck.
