We left Dr. Hank behind. I don't care what others think of this. That man was insane. The moment he spoke up, I knew something was off about him. What if we had more survivors? We can't risk them getting hurt, or even worse, ending up as insane as him. 

"Chief. Take a right here." Aisyah beeped.

"Are we close?" I asked her. 

"We'll be there shortly."

Soon enough, me and John arrived at the workshop. It felt slightly damp and humid. Kind of bothered me a little. John found the light switch and flicked it on. It was in a mess. There were wet spots all around. 

"Sheesh. What happened here." John muttered. 

I touched the wet spots and smelled it. 

"Seems like slime residue." 

I looked around and saw a gas nozzle with a lighter next to it. There were wet spots near it. I picked it up. 

"It looks like someone fought it off." i fiddled with the nozzle.

"You think there might be survivors?"

"Not likely. But keep a lookout."

John nodded. 

We looked around for things we needed. A portable plasma torch, an extra tank of gas, some portable generators and we made a makeshift flamethrower. It was a little too much to carry. After a little more looking around, we found this rather large collapsible wagon, enough to fit our stuff in. 

"That should be all. Aisyah, where to?" I looked at John's breast pocket. 

"We'll be going thought area B6-109. Be extra cautious. I detected some life in there."

Life. That could either be human or rat. 

"Will do Aisyah."

We walked out of the workshop with our items in tow. John was happy that he finally had a weapon he could use. As we got closer to our location, the air began to feel more damp and cold. It felt very uncomfortable. Unnerving. The dark corridor seemed to get much darker than it could get. 

<i>Ooaaaaa</i>

"That was a groan. Right?" John whispered.

<i>OOOOoooaoaAAAA</i>

"Rufiiooooo... It's getting louder...."

"It's not coming closer though."

I walked closer, trying to locate where the noise was coming from. 

"It's definitely here." I looked around confused. "But where is it?"

John tapped my shoulder. His lips was pursed tightly. He pointed upwards.

I looked up.

A human body. 

I swept my lights around. 

Bodies all around. 

Some bones, others still in-process of turning into one.
