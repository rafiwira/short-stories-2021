# Light

I walked around the airlock, inspecting every nook and cranny. Making sure no more dead Desmond was walking around. I tried accessing the doors of the airlock but it seems that they’re all locked out.

My stomach rumbled.

It was hours since I had my dinner. A little late night snack would do me good. I went back to the elevator, pressing the floor that had the nearest cafeteria.

The elevator reached the requested floor. I went out and made my way to the cafeteria. The corridors were dark that I had to use my light again. But as I got closer to the cafeteria, the battery died. Thankfully there were still lights from the machines in there.

As I stepped into the cafeteria, I heard a slight scraping noise coming from the tray return section. Slowly I raised my rifle, walking closer to where the noise was.

I saw a body lying down on its side. I took aim.

“Master Sergeant Rufio. Is that you?” An electronic voice came from the lying body. It started to move a little.

“Who are you? Get up slowly with your hands up.”

The body complied to my command. I recognised the face. He was the troublemaker snooping around the station the other day.

“Turn around.”

He turned.

I moved closer and frisked him. He had something on his breast pocket.

“What’s in your breast pocket. Use your right hand and take it out slowly.”

“Oh. It’s Aisyah.” He did as told.

It was a flashdrive. But a little different from the standard ones we have. Possibly designed for a different purpose.

“Yes it is you Master. Thank goodness.” The drive spoke.

“What are you doing in the drive Aisyah.” I lowered my weapon. “You can turn around now.”

Aisyah started explaining to me what has happened so far. About the overlooking of a fault. How it was empty in the command center. Why she was with John and what they were up to.

“That access huh. Good call to blow it up. Don’t think you would find him anywhere.” I started eating my chicken chop. “Also. It’s dangerous around here. You both haven’t encountered anything yet?”

“Dangerous? What do you mean by anything?”

I stared at John as I chewed the chicken. “You won’t believe me but i’m gonna tell you anyway. There’s some physical anomaly in this station and I have reasons to believe it has taken everyone in this station.”

John had a blank look on his face. I could see he was trying to process it.

“Do you think it’s an organic lifeform Master?”
Aisyah asked.

“Stop calling me Master. Call me sarge or chief.” I sighed. It bother me so much when people call me by that rank. “I believe it might be organic. However, there are still parts of it I can’t understand.”

“Like what?” She said it as though intrigued by it.

I cleared my throat and explained in detail about what had happened throughout the night.
