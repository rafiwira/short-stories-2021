# Artificial Intelligence System for Automation and Hardware

I don’t know what happened. The cell door just opened by itself. What I learned was never to decline such gifts from the almighty.

I gave a little peek.

“Anyone out there?”

Silence.

I guess that’s my cue.

I walked around the corridors, lit dimly by the red emergency lights. There were nobody at all. The doors were all open.

I decided to get into one of them.

“Hello? Anyone in here?”

The room had large windows. There were nothing but bright stars againt the blackness of space. Panels and displays everywhere.

“Where is everybody?”

“I wish I knew.”

That spooked me. A voice came out of the speaker.

“Who’s there?”

“Me.”

A screen lit up. A face was on it. Feminine.

“And who are you exactly?”

“You can call me AISYAH. It’s an abbreviation of my full purpose.”

“What is your full purpose?”

“It would take too long to explain to you. But to make it simple, I take care of this facility.”

“Cool, okay. So where’s everybody?”

She was silent for awhile. As if thinking.

“Gone. Dissappeared.”

“Everyone?”

“Everyone.”

Wow. That’s unbelieveable.

“What happened?”

“I’m not too sure but it seems something has taken hold of this station. And it was hungry. ”

Wow. Again. Unbelievable.

“Oof. Wonder how it happened.”

She went silent for awhile again.

“As I said, I was designed to care for this facility. And in my time of care, I overlooked a minor problem.”

“A system can overlook? And I don’t think you can call this a minor problem.”

“I was designed by your kind. As the saying goes ‘Only God is perfect’. Do you not think so?”

Touché.

This machine has sass installed.

“So how do I escape from here?”

She paused awhile.

“The only logical answer would be the emergency pods. However, it seems that all of it were purged.”

“So i’m stranded here?”

“Not exactly.”

“What do you mean?”

“There is another option. Though information on it should not be relayed to you.”

Why tell me then.

“However. I have deemed the situation as critical. Therefore I shall relay it.”

Something started to whirr. And then a small pop. A flashdrive propped up from the control panel.

“What’s this?”

I walked to it and picked it up.

“It’s me.”

She had move herself over to the device.

“I shall be your guide.”

“Guide? To where exactly?”

“To the option I had stated. I shall relay it as we go.”

“Fine.”

I stuffed her in my breast pocket and walked out the command center.
