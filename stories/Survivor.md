# Survivor

We stood there, relieved that we survived the attack. We were too optimistic in thinking that it would be a walk in the park. With this attack, a new possibility came to mind. Could this creature telepathically communicate? I know it sounds absurd, but this situation itself is already absurd to begin with. So I think it's fair to think something so scientifically hard to comprehend could happen.

"It may be possible. But not with this creature." Aisyah answered. "Assuming they could, I would think they would have sent it electromagnetically like radio waves seeing as how they are built."

I looked at Rufio. His hands on his chin, deep in thought.

"So if it's not that, then what?" I was half-offended, half-curious that Aisyah threw my hypothesis out.

"It is possible that it was a message relay."

"Message relay?" I scratched my head.

"Yes. Like the broken telephone game. But more efficient."

She started explaining quite simply. The master thinker - or what she calls the core - sends out a message to one of the closer ancillaries. That ancillary begins to move to the next closest ancillary to pass the message. They would have to connect physically to receive that message.

"But what about what Rufio saw. We can't discount the fact that it could do <i>that</i>."

"I'm not. But as of now, it is likely only the core would have that potential. Else, we would have been doomed early."

There were still so many questions in my mind. It just doesn't make sense why we were the only survivors. What was it that kept us safe. Kept us from being consumed by this thing.

<i>Thud</i>

Something fell. This time it sounded like a sack of potatoes fell.

Rufio and I stared at where the noise came from. He pulled out his rifle, moving closer to the source. I followed close to him. As we got closer, we saw hair on the floor, poking out of the corner of the lab desk.

"Who's there." Rufio raised his voice.

And when there was no reply, he rushed in, his rifle trained on the tuft at all times. Then he lowered it and looked at me.

I walked over and saw a man, lying unconscious on the ground.
