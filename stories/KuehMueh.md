# *Kueh Mueh*

We sat quietly. Listening out for any noises. There was nothing much that we could do. We were dependant on Aisyah to track its movements. As of now, we can't tell of how it's sensing us. 

"So. What now?" John whispered. 

"We wait out till Aisyah can tell us where it is."

You could hear the flash drive fan in John's pocket was whirring. It seemed that she was doing her best to track it. This station was fitted with sensors all around. The problem though is that the slime had broken some of the sensors. So we're sitting ducks until Aisyah has a clear answer for us. 

*Crinkle.*

I looked at John.

He took out a plastic wrapping out of his pocket. He then proceeded to open it up and took out its content. It had a green top layer and a white bottom layer stuck together. He saw me looking at him. 

"You want some?" he asked.

"what's that?"

I swore I could see his jaw drop. 

"You don't know what this is?"

"If I knew I wouldn't be asking."

He gave a soft chuckle. 

"This my friend, is what is called *kueh*. In it's plural form, *kueh mueh*. There is a specific name for this *kueh* but it's escaping my thought right now."

He handed it to me. 

"Use your fingertips. It's sticky."

I took it from him. He wasn't lying. It was sticky. 

I put it in my mouth and chew. 

Woah. Tasty.

There's a mix of sweet, a hint of fattiness, smooth and soft, and stickiness all around. 

"Not bad right?" he grinned.

"Not bad."

*Beep.*

"If you boys are done, I would like to brief you on our possible plan."

I gulped the last bite down.

"Tell us Aisyah. How screwed are we."
