# The Thirteenth Hour

Everyone is gone. Nobody is safe. I don't know what these things are. All I know is that it's coming for us. 

I saw it. I saw it pulling people away. Men, women, children and even animals. Anything it could reach out for is doomed to be caught. 

Unaware of its presence, it distracts you, then in an instant, one body gone. Then another. And another.

The way that it hunts, is a testament to its intellect and instinct. I've seen it play with its prey when its alone. As its prey begged for mercy, it pretends to give in, but instead does the opposite, killing and consuming its prey in the most horrible way. Suffocating its prey with its gel like body, then slowly enveloping around, restricting its prey's movement and finally digesting it.  

It doesn't take long for it to fully digest an adult human. In a mere hour, the skin peels away, in another hour, the muscles around the body was gone. In another half an hour, the organs dissolves as well. It has no interest in the bones. It would push out the bones, leaving it lying on the ground. The bones leaves a horrid stench. What's worse was that it seems to pile up the bones in one room. As to why it does this, I can only assume that it does not want the stench to spread, leaving traces of death would only deter its prey from coming in.

They were translucent and now it had turned into other shades of red as they kept consuming. I had seen a few that had shades of purple. It could be that my eyes were playing tricks on me. Anyone could give a guess as to why it was red. The blood it consumed has stained its body. But it pays no attention to it. To it, colour was of no issue. Its stealth doesn't depend on its shade of colour. Its intelligence was enough.

I've managed to keep away from it for as long as I could. But I don't know if I can last any longer.

Everywhere I turn, I witness another horror. 

There's nobody else that I can rely on. 

No matter how many survivors I saw, I was always a step too late. 

It got to them before I could do anything.

Its cornering me. It knows I'm here. That I am alone.

It wants me to fear.

It wants to savour me. 

Oh how what a twisted fate.
