# Farewell

After what happened to Desmond, I can’t shake off the feeling that something sinister was going to happen. I don’t want to assume that Desmond and his team are KIA. But it’s really likely that might be the case.

Their last known patrol route was the cargo airlock. It’s somewhere at the bottom of the station. There’s a few specific elevators that can directly reach it.

I reached the elevator and pressed the button. It closed and the elevator wooshed down. As it went down, my comlink began to output a strange static noise.

Then it got slightly coherent.

“Ru.. fi.. o..”

My comlink kept repeating that over the static.

The elevator arrived. When it opened, the area was dark. I flicked on my headlight and started to sweep the area. Nothing seemed to stand out.

There was a faint sticky noise.

I adjusted my light to look further.

A figure was limping about. I couldn’t make out who it was as it was moving away from me. I picked up my pace.

As I got closer, I could see slime covering the entirety of the person. That would explain the sticky noise. I tried to look beyond the slime covering to see if I could identify anything.

A familiar custom decorated holster.

“Desmond.”

The figure turned around.

“Ru… fi… o…”

At one glance, I knew it was him. And I knew he wasn’t there anymore. I raised my rifle and shot him thrice.

His body stumbled back and fell. It gurgled and got back up.

Somehow, this one’s different. Why didn’t it run away?

Dead Desmond raised his arm and whipped out his slime as he brought it down. He was as bad as he was alive. He missed me.

I didn’t gave him a chance to correct himself. I fled the area. If rifle bolts won’t work, i’ll need to try something else. As I was running, I found a blowtorch tank.

I looked back and saw dead Desmond still limping after me. I went further ahead far enough for cover but still visible for dead Desmond and the tanks.

I took aim at the tanks. As soon as dead Desmond was close enough, I fired.

The two gas mixed and ignited. A bright flash from the fire and the explosion shook the area. I waited a few second and walked over.

Lumps of dead Desmond.

I looked around and observed him. No movements. That’s good. I stood at an attention and lowered my head.

Farewell my friend.
