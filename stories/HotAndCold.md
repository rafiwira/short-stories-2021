# Hot and Cold

AISYAH had told me of the plan. There was a ship that’s stored near the Command Centre - where we were. But the thing was, it needed the Station Commander’s keycard. No other options could open it up.

Unless by brute force.

So here we are walking down the corridor. Going towards the workshop. Hopefully we could find some blowtorch or anything more powerful than that. It was either that or try to find the keycard in this vast station.

I saw a sign. Cafeteria.

No harm going for a detour.

“This isn’t where we’re supposed to go John.” Aisyah spoke up.

“Just a little detour. I’m a little hungry.”

The cafeteria was pretty huge. Surprisingly, some of the machines still had their lights on. I went to the nearest one. It read “Wackadodal”. I think it was a famius fast food chain.

I looked at the menu. Something caught my eye.

French fries.

And hot chocolate sundae.

I pressed on both of them.

The machine whirred awhile and vended out my selection. I took them both on each hand and sat down.

“That’s not a complete meal ya know.” Aisyah must have seen what I chose.

“Yea but it’s been a long time since I had it.”

I took a piece of the freshly fried fries and dipped into the cold dessert. As I pulled it out, I made sure that it had the vanilla ice-cream and chocolate fudge coated on it. I popped the whole thing in my mouth.

The cold sensation from the ice-cream spread around my mouth. Sweetness from it and the chocolate. Then the warmth of the fries and the savouriness that came with the salt.

“That never gets old.” I grinned.

“You’re like a kid.”

I laughed at her comment. I took my time to savour the food. After I was done, I took a look at the menu again and ordered a burger. I grabbed it and ate as I walked towards the other entrance.

As I walked closer, I heard footsteps. I choked on my burger and tried to find a hiding spot. I found a tray return section and dived in.

I kept my breathing steady and kept my ears sharp.

I heard murmurs.

And a familiar looking boot came into view.
