# Cold

Honestly, why do weird things always happen to me. I did nothing wrong and I was sent to the lockup. And before that, I somehow was shoved into the shuttle bound for this station. And before that, I lost my wallet of all things.

Don’t get me started on the series of events in my life that nearly got me.

“John. Hurry up.”

I looked up at Rufio.

“The path ahead is safe.” Aisyah beeped out from my pocket.

The Slime has been pretty dormant so far. Though I don’t think that’s going to last long. With Aisyah’s guidance, we’ve managed not to alert any of it. We’ve seen a few sticking out of vents or just wiggling by itself. But it seems that none of them cared if we passed by.

I have some thoughts about what this thing was. These things are probably connected to a master thinker. They're each given specific commands. If parted with the master, they're nothing but ancillaries with minimal thoughts. At this point I'm guessing, we are of no threat. That's most probably why these ancillaries aren't chasing us. On how they communicate though, that is something I can't tell for now.

Based on what Rufio has shared, this thing might possess supernatural powers. Sounds like it came from some Lovecraftian horror. We can’t be too careful.

<i>Bang</i>

"What was that..." I looked around, asking Rufio, hoping he could tell me what that was.

"Sounds like something heavy fell."

From the dark, we could see it. It was massive, filling up the whole corridor. It was slowly making its way towards us. We started running.

"Get in the next room you see." Aisyah beeped.

We did as told and ended up in a very cold room.

"Where are we?" Rufio asked.

"The lab."

Rufio looked around.

"John, take this." he handed me his rifle.

He walked close to one of the gas cylinders and began dismantling it. As he was doing so, the slime had reached the door.

"Rufio it's at the door!"

Rufio looked at me. Hands still working on the cylinder.

"You got the gun. SHOOT IT!"

I took aim and started shooting at it.

Chunk by chunk the plasma took away the Slime. But it wasn't enough to stop it.

"Alright. Got it." Rufio heaved the cylinder on to his shoulder.

He stood in front and started releasing the gas on to the oncoming Slime.

As the gas came in contact, the Slime made a shrieking noise. It froze up and the freezing didn't end there. You could see crystal slowly creeping up the slime. The Slime started backing away, as if knowing it was in danger. Rufio didn't let up. He moved forward cautiously, the huge cylinder still on his shoulder. He kept spraying the gas on to the Slime.

Soon enough, the slime disappeared back into the dark.

"Oh my God. We're safe." I sighed. I could feel my body loosening up drastically.

"For now."

I looked at Rufio.

"Yeah. For now."
