# Shorted

We shook him. Trying to rouse him. His tag showed his name as Dr Hank.

His body was slightly cold to the touch. Rufio was worried we might have lost him to hypothermia. 

Slowly we could his eyes opening. 

"Dr Hank. Are you okay? What happened?" I tapped on his shoulder again.

"Where... where am I?" He started to sit himself.

"In the lab. Can you remember anything?"

His eyes widened. 

"THE SLIME."

That shocked us. Never saw that coming. Who knew an unconscious man could suddenly spring out so much energy.

"We need to get closer to it."

"Whoa whoa slow down." I tried to calm him down.

Rufio kneeled next to him.

"Doctor. We're glad you're alright. Like what John said. Calm yourself first."

"I AM CALM."

I could see Rufio roll his eyes in disbelief.

"Okay. But why must we get closer to it. Don't you think it's safer to escape?" I asked.

"And once we've escaped, then what?"

"We'll think about that when the time comes." Rufio interrupted me. "It's no use thinking about 'what ifs' when we can't even escape from it."

"If we die will you take responsibility?" Dr Hank hissed at him. 

"Sure. If that would make you feel better."

Dr Hank glared back at him, fuming from Rufio's quick retorts.

"Ok ok. can we all calm down. Take a deep breath and have a proper man-to-man talk."

"Tell me how am I supposed to talk like a man when this <i>brute</i> insists on doing things <i>his</i> way."

I gave a nervous chuckle. 

Rufio stood by the door, leaning on to the its frame.

"Rufio" I whispered. "Can we just amuse him. Look we can pretend tha-" he placed his hand over my mouth. He signed me to keep quiet. Then signed to listen.

A faint gurgling. 

It is faint. But my gut tells me that it might be something huge that made that low gurgle. And it may sound far, but I'm pretty sure it's <i>not</i> that far.

"WILL YOU BOTH LISTEN!" Dr Hank shouted at the top of his lungs.

Rufio and my eyes widened. We both stared at him. This man has issues.

Rufio as quietly and as swiftly went over to him and covered Dr Hank's mouth. In a panic, I signed to Dr Hank to keep his mouth shut. 

"There's something out there!" I whispered to him.

He pulled away Rufio's hand.

"All the more reason for us to think NOW!" 

This man has some really serious issues.

I looked at Rufio. His patience was thinning faster than a shaved ice. 

He poked Dr Hank with a syringe.

"What.. did... oh..." Dr Hank thumped to the floor.

"Let's leave him." Rufio annoyed.

"He might prove himself useful later." I tried to reason. But honestly I doubted it.

"I'm sorry. As much as I would like to rescue all survivors, this man may compromise both our safety."

I nodded back at him.

"You're right."

There's no point risking our lives. We have to get out of here. We need to warn others of this thing.
