# Proposal

Everything was going well. The flowers, the food, the music. I had her blindfolded and walked her to our room. Just as she removed the blindfold, the room went dark.

I reached out to hold her hand, but it wasn’t there. I called out her name. She didn’t answer. When the emergency lights turned on, she wasn’t anywhere in the room.

No sound.

Just gone.

The door hissed as I walked out the door to the hallway. It glowed red just like the rooms. I screamed her name. No reply. I hear murmurs nearby. I walked closer and I saw a small group circling around a lady.

She was sobbing with her hands pressed on her face.

“He was there one moment. And then when the lights came on, all I saw were these big stains all over the room.” She flailed her hand towards her door.

I went closer to it.

There was a familiar stench.

Blood.

The announcement came on. They told us to calmly make our way to the escape pods. Not a very good choice of words for now. But we all seemed to comply. We made our way to the pods.

When we were about halfway through to the pods, some of us realised there were missing people. We didn’t think much about it and kept walking. They probably were slower.

But it got weirder as we reached the pods. Only a third of us were in the pod bay.

We asked for opinions. Should we check if anyone’s lagging behind? Should we just go and escape ahead?

I told them i’ll stay behind. I’ll be the last to leave. Some agreed. Most didn’t care. All they wanted was to leave.

They began preparing for launch, but the lights went out.

Then came back on.

And off.

And on.

It flickered.

And with each flicker, someone seemed to go missing.

When they realised what was happening, they rushed to the pods. In their rush and panic, some pods flew out empty.

Then all the pods went out empty.

It was if something had pressed the launch buttons at one go.

People kept disappearing.

And finally I was alone.

I could feel sweat trickling down my face.

“Jordan.”

A familiar voice.

“Is that you Anna?”

I replied.

She walked out of the shadow.

“It’s me. Where were you?”

“I was looking for you. You vanished when the lights came on.”

“Jordan. Do you really want to marry me?”

I teared.

“Of course Anna! I love you!”

I hugged her.

She felt different.

She hugged me.

It felt different.

“I love you too Jordan.”

She sounds different.

I can’t breathe.

It’s dark.
