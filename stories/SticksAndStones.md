# Stick and Stones

After we had our fix of supper, we started making our way to the workshop. There was a good chance we could find something that could break open the thick doors to our escape. On a normal day, we could access it by the cargo airlock. But currently the doors of the airlock are offline. Aisyah had tried to access it too but according to her, there was a foreign intervention preventing her from accessing the rights to it.

"Hey I was thinking. Shouldn't I get a weapon too?"

I looked over to John.

"Nahh, you'll be fine John. Just stay close to me."

I know he had went through the mandatory conscription. But that was on land. Here in space, there are variables we need to consider. Plus, we would have to take a detour. The armoury is at the mid-deck, on the opposite end of where we were heading to.

"Sergeant, I'm detecting movement." Aisyah beeped. "Vents."

I readied my rifle. Something was definitely in the vents.

"Aisyah, can you identify what it is?"

"A moment."

Her fan vented up. I guess she was running some hard stuff.

"Vents from section E333 onward are compromised. Life form, unknown."

That was all I needed to know.

I rummaged through my vest and took out a sticky grenade.

"Get behind me."

I pulled the ring and stuck it to the vent. I turned and ran to John pulling him along.

The grenade exploded.

I turned back to see the damage.

Slime was oozing out of the damaged vent.

"Aisyah, please categorise them now as slime."

She beeped. "Done."

"And please advice us on an escape."

She beeped again. "Down the hall."

We moved over as directed.

"So now what." John asked, exhausted.

I looked at him.

"Honestly I don't know. We'll have to depend on Aisyah to track these slime. We'll have to do some investigation on it."

John stared at me.

"What?"

"So... weapons?"
